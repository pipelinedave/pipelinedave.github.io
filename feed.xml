There are manifests to write, configurations to track, deployments to verify, and the ever-present challenge of keeping documentation in sync with reality. For a while now, I’ve been on a journey to refine my k3s cluster management, and I’m thrilled to share a setup that has truly transformed my workflow: a GitOps-centric approach supercharged by GitHub Copilot.</p>

<p>My entire cluster configuration lives in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k3s-config</code> repository, which you can explore to see these principles in action.</p>

<h2 id="the-foundation-gitops-with-fluxcd">The Foundation: GitOps with FluxCD</h2>

<p>At the heart of my strategy is a steadfast commitment to GitOps. For me, this means the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k3s-config</code> Git repository is the <em>single source of truth</em>. If it’s not in the repo, it doesn’t (or shouldn’t) exist in the cluster. FluxCD is the diligent operator that makes this happen, continuously reconciling the state of my cluster with what’s defined in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch.</p>

<p>This provides a solid baseline:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Version Control for Infrastructure</strong>: Every change is a commit, auditable and revertible.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: What you see in Git is what you get in the cluster.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation</strong>: Flux handles the deployment pipeline automatically.</li>
</ul>

<p>But even with this robust foundation, the manual effort of creating, updating, and documenting configurations can be significant. That’s where my AI assistant steps in.</p>

<h2 id="the-supercharger-github-copilot-joins-the-fray">The Supercharger: GitHub Copilot Joins the Fray</h2>

<p>Integrating GitHub Copilot into my daily operations has been nothing short of a game-changer. It’s not just about code completion; it’s about having an intelligent partner that understands my specific context, patterns, and even my documentation needs.</p>

<p>Here’s how Copilot elevates my GitOps workflow:</p>

<h3 id="1-accelerated-development-and-manifest-creation">1. Accelerated Development and Manifest Creation</h3>

<p>Writing YAML can be tedious and error-prone. Copilot, armed with the context of my repository (including my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cluster-context.md</code> which outlines my specific conventions), significantly speeds this up.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Smart Manifest Generation</strong>: Need a new Deployment, Service, or Ingress? Copilot can draft it based on a simple prompt, often correctly inferring details like application names and port numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Adherence to Standards</strong>: I have critical protection policies, like ensuring all PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubernetes.io/pvc-protection</code> finalizer and that all Ingresses follow my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app-name.stillon.top</code> domain schema with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">letsencrypt-prod</code> issuer. Copilot helps me remember and implement these by suggesting the correct snippets or even modifying existing manifests to include them.</li>
  <li><strong>Flux Kustomizations</strong>: Creating the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kustomization</code> resources in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code> directory to tell Flux about new applications is also streamlined. Copilot knows the structure and can generate the necessary YAML quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-living-breathing-documentation">2. Living, Breathing Documentation</h3>

<p>This is perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects. I’ve established an “Auto-Documentation Update” process where Copilot plays a key role. When I make significant changes or explicitly ask, Copilot helps me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Update Application Lists</strong>: It can scan my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps-incomplete/</code> directories and update the “Fully Managed Applications” and “Partially Managed Applications” sections in my documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify Repository Structure</strong>: It helps ensure my documented repository structure matches reality.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep Key Scripts Documented</strong>: New scripts in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scripts/</code> or changes to existing ones? Copilot assists in updating their descriptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs/README.md</code> and the crucial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cluster-context.md</code> (which Copilot itself uses for context!) stay remarkably up-to-date. It’s like having a dedicated technical writer who’s also an expert on my system.</p>

<h3 id="3-intelligent-cluster-interaction-via-mcp-tools">3. Intelligent Cluster Interaction via MCP Tools</h3>

<p>Through Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, Copilot can directly (but safely) interact with my cluster for verification and troubleshooting. Instead of me manually running a series of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubectl</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flux</code> commands, I can ask Copilot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Are all pods running in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">choremane-prod</code> namespace?” (Uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bb7_pods_list_in_namespace</code>)</li>
  <li>“What’s the status of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docspell</code> Kustomization in Flux?” (Uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bb7_get_kubernetes_resources</code>)</li>
  <li>“Show me the recent logs for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">linkding</code> pod.” (Uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bb7_pods_log</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If something seems off, Copilot can even suggest reconciliation commands or help pinpoint issues by analyzing resource statuses.</p>

<h3 id="4-guardian-of-best-practices">4. Guardian of Best Practices</h3>

<p>My workflow has specific manual steps, like creating namespaces with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubectl create namespace &lt;namespace&gt;</code> <em>before</em> Flux tries to deploy to them (a crucial step to protect PVCs). Copilot consistently reminds me of these nuances. Similarly, when handling sensitive data, it guides me through the SealedSecrets workflow: create locally, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kubeseal</code>, commit the sealed version, and delete the original.</p>

<h2 id="a-peek-inside-my-k3s-config-repository">A Peek Inside My <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k3s-config</code> Repository</h2>

<p>My repository structure is designed to support this workflow:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kustomize/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kustomize-incomplete/</code>: Contain the actual Kubernetes manifests.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apps-incomplete/</code>: House the Flux Kustomization CRDs that point to the manifest directories.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flux-system/</code>: Holds the Flux bootstrap configuration.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs/</code>: The comprehensive documentation hub, co-maintained by me and Copilot.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scripts/</code>: Utility scripts, often for tasks that bridge manual steps and GitOps.</li>
</ul>

<p>This clear separation of concerns makes it easy for both humans and Copilot to navigate and understand the configuration.</p>

<h2 id="the-payoff-tangible-benefits">The Payoff: Tangible Benefits</h2>

<p>Adopting this Copilot-enhanced GitOps model has yielded significant advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increased Speed</strong>: Repetitive tasks are automated or significantly sped up.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved Consistency</strong>: Adherence to my standards is much higher.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced Errors</strong>: Fewer typos or forgotten critical configurations in my YAML.</li>
  <li><strong>Truly Up-to-Date Documentation</strong>: This alone is a massive win.</li>
  <li><strong>Empowered Me</strong>: Complex Kubernetes operations become more accessible with an AI assistant ready to guide and explain.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Learning</strong>: Copilot often shows me efficient ways to achieve tasks or reminds me of commands and configurations, acting as an interactive learning tool.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>My journey with k3s, GitOps, Flux, and now GitHub Copilot has been incredibly rewarding. It feels like I’m at the forefront of a new era in operations, where AI doesn’t just assist with code but becomes an integral part of managing complex systems. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k3s-config</code> repository is a living testament to this synergy.</p>

<p>If you’re managing Kubernetes, I highly encourage you to explore how a GitOps foundation, coupled with the intelligence of tools like GitHub Copilot, can revolutionize your workflows. It certainly has for me!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="kubernetes" /><category term="gitops" /><category term="flux" /><category term="copilot" /><category term="automation" /><category term="devops" /><category term="k3s" /><category term="kubernetes" /><category term="k3s" /><category term="gitops" /><category term="flux" /><category term="copilot" /><category term="ai" /><category term="automation" /><category term="devops" /><category term="cluster-management" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Managing Kubernetes clusters, even a relatively streamlined one like k3s, can often feel like a juggling act.

<p>As developers, we constantly juggle ideas, bug fixes, and feature requests while working on projects. Often, these ideas strike us at the most inconvenient times: mid-task, during debugging, or when implementing a feature. To address this chaotic yet inevitable part of the creative process, I’ve built the <strong>Copilot Todo System</strong>.</p>

<p>This system, which you can find in the <a href="https://github.com/pipelinedave/copilot-todo-system-template">Copilot Todo System Template repository</a>, is designed to bring order to the chaos by leveraging GitHub Copilot as your task management assistant.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-problem-too-many-unorganized-ideas">The Problem: Too Many Unorganized Ideas</h3>

<p>In my daily workflow, I often encounter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ideas for new features while working on unrelated tasks</li>
  <li>Bugs and issues that need fixing but not immediately</li>
  <li>Performance improvements or maintenance tasks that are low priority</li>
</ul>

<p>The result? A cluttered list of bullet points in a markdown file, sticky notes, or worse—mental overload. I needed a hands-off solution to manage this without interrupting my flow.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-solution-automated-organization-with-copilot">The Solution: Automated Organization with Copilot</h3>

<p>The <strong>Copilot Todo System</strong> is a simple yet powerful task management approach. Here’s how it works:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A Centralized Todo File</strong>: All ideas, issues, bugs, and tasks are added to a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github/copilot/Todo.md</code> file.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Organization</strong>: Every time I mention “todo” in a Copilot chat, it parses the file, formalizes tasks, and organizes them into categories and priorities.</li>
  <li><strong>Hands-Off Updates</strong>: I can keep adding bullet points anywhere in the file, and Copilot will ensure the file remains clean, structured, and actionable.</li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent Suggestions</strong>: Copilot reviews the tasks, prioritizes them, and even suggests the next best task to tackle.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h3>

<p>The repository includes a sample structure for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github/copilot/Todo.md</code> and instructions for Copilot to follow. Here’s a quick overview of the setup:</p>

<p>Man, if you’re like me, you dig how macOS handles three-finger swipes to switch desktops. It’s smooth, it’s cool, it’s where it’s at. But what about us Linux folks? We want in on that action too, right?</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>

<p>The jam is simple. On macOS, a three-finger swipe on the trackpad lets you seamlessly switch between virtual desktops. It’s slicker than a greased-up watermelon, let me tell you. Now, Linux ain’t natively geared for that, but why should we miss out?</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Hold tight, ‘cause this is where the magic happens. We’re gonna use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libinput</code> to catch touchpad events and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wmctrl</code> to switch desktops. You dig?</p>

<p>Before runnin’ the script, make sure you’ve got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wmctrl</code> installed. If not, hit it with:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

<h2 id="the-problem-long-whatsapp-voice-notes">The Problem: Long WhatsApp Voice Notes</h2>

<p>The genesis of memodawg was driven by the cumbersome task of managing long WhatsApp voice notes. Such notes are not only time-consuming to listen to but also tricky to navigate if you want to revisit specific sections.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>memodawg is an innovative platform designed to streamline the experience of handling long voice notes through a process called memoization. Crafted in Go, it provides a performance-optimized, user-friendly way to engage with your voice notes.</p>

<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>

<p>The project is segmented into two primary components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api</code>: The backend, engineered in Go, serves as the heart of memoization operations for voice notes. It manages audio files, performs the memoization, and returns the processed notes to the frontend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend</code>: Also powered by Go, this segment offers a simplified UI to interact with your memoized voice notes. It connects to the backend for all operations and presents a seamless user experience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these components is neatly packed with its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go.mod</code> file, allowing for localized dependency management and version control.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>

<p>Upon uploading a voice note to memodawg, the backend takes over and performs memoization. This involves parsing the audio file into smaller, labeled segments for easier navigation. The frontend then allows you to interact with these memoized sections, providing an organized, hassle-free way to engage with long audio messages.</p>

<h2 id="dockerized-for-deployment">Dockerized for Deployment</h2>

<p>Both the backend (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">api</code>) and frontend are Dockerized, making the application easily deployable and manageable. It encapsulates the environment, ensuring consistency across different stages of deployment.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes-support">Kubernetes Support</h2>

<p>memodawg also ships with ready-to-use Kubernetes manifests, providing a straightforward path to scale the application in a Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that memodawg is not just a solution for individuals but can be robustly scaled to serve multiple users across various environments.</p>

<h2 id="newest-feature-idea-azure-quota-notifications">Newest Feature Idea: Azure Quota Notifications</h2>

<p>To add even more value, an upcoming feature aims to offer automatic notifications about your remaining Azure free quota, aiding users in better cloud resource management.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>A non-tech-savvy friend of mine recently decided to open a tattoo studio. I offered to build and host a website for his new venture with minimal cost, maintenance, and coding effort. In this post, I’ll share how I set up a mobile-friendly, SEO-optimized, single-scrolling landing page that makes it easy for customers to get in touch and complies with German law.</p>

<p>First, I registered the TLD brotherhood.ink, which was available and perfectly suited for a tattoo studio. The site needed to serve as a landing page, featuring a simple contact form, a list of offered services, and owner information. Ideally, the site would also integrate the artist’s Instagram feed, filtering by specific hashtags to keep content fresh and relevant.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>To achieve this, I chose <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> as a free, highly available hosting platform, and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as a static site generator. I configured the domain’s DNS to point to GitHub Pages and set up the repository accordingly.</p>

<p>I found a free theme that met our requirements: <a href="https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme">Agency Jekyll Theme</a>. I cloned the theme’s repository into a “jekyll” subfolder within our project root, which simplified the deployment process.</p>

<p>Next, I created a Gemfile to list the required Ruby Gems like Jekyll and some additional helpful gems:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="n">source</span> <span class="s1">'https://rubygems.org'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'jekyll'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'jekyll-paginate'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'jekyll-sitemap'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'jekyll-feed'</span>
<span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">'jekyll-seo-tag'</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added a GitHub workflow that automates the process of building and deploying the Jekyll site to the gh-pages branch whenever changes are pushed to the main branch or a manual dispatch is triggered. The workflow caches Ruby gems and uses the <a href="https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action">jekyll-action</a> to build and deploy the site.</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>After configuring the deployment branch and enabling HTTPS, I navigated to <a href="https://brotherhood.ink">https://brotherhood.ink</a> and saw the theme’s default look. I then replaced the stock content with the actual business information, tweaked the layout, and replaced the header image.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There’s still work to be done, such as integrating the Instagram feed, utilizing the installed Jekyll plugins like jekyll-seo-tag, setting up Google Analytics, configuring a mail server, and more. Stay tuned for updates!</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the technologies utilized:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme">Agency Jekyll Theme</a></li>

<h2 id="the-issue">The Issue</h2>

<p>I was using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helaili/jekyll-action@v2</code> Jekyll GitHub Action from the marketplace to build and deploy my site, and I came across an error in my workflow:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre><span class="go">env: can't execute 'ruby-2.7': No such file or directory
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Later, after some adjustments, I encountered another error:</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>To fix the compatibility issue with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sass-embedded</code> gem, I used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pre_build_commands</code> option of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helaili/jekyll-action@v2</code> action to update RubyGems before building the site. Here’s my final, working GitHub Actions workflow:</p>
